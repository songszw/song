    When I was young I'd listen to the radio
　　Waiting for my favorite songs
　　When they played I'd sing along
　　It make me smile
　　Those were such happy times and not so long ago
　　宋智文万岁万岁万万岁
　　But they're back again just like a long lost friend
　　All the songs I love so well
　　Every shalala every wo'wostill shines
　　Every shing-a-ling-a-ling that they're starting to sing so fine
　　When they get to the part
　　Where he's breaking her heart
　　It can really make me cry
　　Just like before
　　It's yesterday once more
　　(Shoobie do lang lang*)
　　(Shoobie do lang lang)
    Looking back on how it was in years gone by
　　And the good times that I had
　　Makes today seem rather sad
　　So much has changed
　　It was songs of love that I would sing to them
　　And I'd memorise each word
　　Those old melodies still sound so good to me
　　As they melt the years away
　　Every shalala every wo'wo still shines
　　Every shing-a-ling-a-ling that they're starting to sing so fine
　　All my best memories
　　Come back clearly to me
　　Some can even make me cry
　　Just like before
　　It's yesterday once more
　　(Shoobie do lang lang)
　　Every shalala every wo'wo still shines
　　Every shing-a-ling-a-ling that they're starting to sing so fine
　　Every shalala every wo'wo still shines
　　Every shing-a-ling-a-ling that they're starting to sing so fine
